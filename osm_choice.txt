Map Area: Portland, OR United States
https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/portland_oregon/
The area I chose to explore is Portland, Oregon in United States.
Portland, Oregon’s largest city, sits on the Columbia and Willamette rivers, in the shadow of snow-capped Mount Hood. 
It’s known for its parks, bridges and bicycle paths, as well as for its eco-friendliness and its microbreweries and coffeehouses.¹

The reason why I chose Portland to explore is because I've visited once before and would like to live there one day. 
It is a lovely city with unique neighborhoods and this project presented an opportunity to explore it further.
